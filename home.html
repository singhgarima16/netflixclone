                        <h1>Keepvid is Youtube playlist downloader</h1><br>
                        <p>Many a website say they can do youtube playlists, but very few can actually show playlist contents and give you the opportunity to work with videos included in this playlist. Keepvid is one of those who can. Here you'll have to copy video URL, though, because search only works for single videos. You can also use bookmarklet, just hit it when you're on Youtube's page with playlist, and all will be taken care of..</p>

                        <h1>Keepvid is Youtube subtitle downloader</h1><br>
                        <p>Don't look anywhere else, it is right here in front of you - the best youtube video subtitle converter on the internet. The process is intuitive and simple. It involves all same steps as downloading any video, just when you have the download options - look for the one that says subtitle and hit download. A new button will load up after a few moments, you need to press that button and wait a max of 10-15 seconds for youtube video to be converted to mp4 with subtitle. Download will begin on its own when converter finishes its work. Easy? I would think so..</p>

                    <p class="p1">We made our mp3 converter ready for everything Youtube related. So it can work with long Youtube playlists. We also figured you won't need to download the whole thing, even several files at a time is a bad idea - they must come as zip file.. So we just give you the list of all videos in the playlist, and it's up to you which ones you want to download. One by one. But each one mp3 will come with video metadata included as mp3 IDv3 tags, so to say artist name, song title, album, genre, track number, and video thumbnail will be included as album art.. So.. What are you waiting for? Isn't keepvid awesome? Give it a try.</p>
